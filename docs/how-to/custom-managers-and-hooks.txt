Custom managers and hooks
=========================

This document will explain how managers and hooks are used in Socon and how you can use
it in your own framework. Managers and hooks are powerful features of Socon that
will make your framework generic and maintainable.

.. note::

    A :doc:`tutorial </intro/tutorials/3_manager>` is available on
    managers and hooks that you should do if you are new to Socon.

Manager
=======

The term **manager** in Socon describes a super class that provides features
to find, register and manipulate ``hooks``. For example, the commands management
module contain a ``CommandManager`` which inherit from the base class
:class:`~socon.core.manager.BaseManager`. This class, registers every command that
are in the ``management/commands`` directory alongside the configuration in which
they are linked to.

By subclassing your class from the :class:`~socon.core.manager.BaseManager` and by
explicitly placing your managers class into a file called :file:`managers.py` at
the root of a plugin, a project or in the common space; Socon will automatically
register that class as a ``manager``. When you create your manager, you will need
to define two mandatory attributes:

#. :attr:`~socon.core.manager.BaseManager.name`: The name of the manager. This name
   must be unique across your entire framework including the plugins.

#. :attr:`~socon.core.manager.BaseManager.lookup_module`: The full python path to
   the module that contains hooks linked to this manager.

Here is quick example. Let's create a ``BuildManager`` at the root of the
common space in the ``manager.py`` like so::

    myframework/
        myframework/
            __init__.py
            management/
            managers.py
        manage.py

Let's have a closer look to the :file:`managers.py`:

.. code-block:: python
    :caption: myframework/managers.py

    from socon.core.manager import BaseManager


    class BuildManager(BaseManager):
        name = 'build'
        lookup_module = 'builder'

When Socon starts, it registers all registry configurations and imports at the
same time every :file:`managers.py`. The import registers every ``manager`` in the
:attr:`~socon.core.manager.BaseManager._managers` private attribute.

.. _access-your-managers:

Access your managers
--------------------

You can access any manager using the :meth:`~socon.core.manager.BaseManager.get_manager`
method. Here is an example to get the ``BuildManager`` manager. We
will pretend to have a ``build`` command that will access this manager.

.. code-block:: python
    :caption: myframework/management/commands/build.py

    from socon.core.management.base import ProjectCommand
    from socon.core.manager import BaseManager


    class BuildCommand(ProjectCommand):
        name = 'build'

    def handle(self, config, project_config):
        manager = BaseManager.get_manager('build')

Accessing your manager, will let you find, access and use your hooks.

Module introspection
--------------------

When a manager searches for a hook, it calls the
:meth:`~socon.core.manager.BaseManager.get_modules` method. This method by default
returns the :attr:`RegistryConfig.name <socon.core.registry.RegistryConfig.name>` + the
:attr:`~socon.core.manager.BaseManager.lookup_module`.
For example: ``projects.apollo.builder`` if we are looking for the builder module
inside the project ``apollo``. Then we import the module and every class that
inherits from :class:`~socon.core.manager.Hook` will be registered to its manager.

By overriding the :meth:`~socon.core.manager.BaseManager.get_modules` method, you
can provide your own way of finding modules. That is what we have done for
the :class:`CommandManager`. The method returns every modules that are in the
``management/commands`` directory.

Hooks
=====

The term **hooks** in Socon describes a piece of code, generally a subclass
of the base class :class:`~socon.core.manager.Hook` that a user can define to
extend or replace the current code being executed.
:class:`~socon.core.management.ProjectCommand` and
:class:`~socon.core.management.BaseCommand` are hooks of a ``CommandManager``.
All subclass of these two super classes, will be registered in the ``CommandManager``.

.. note::

    Hooks are nothing less than a class that is linked to a manager to do
    anything you want. As we said in the beginning of this document
    :class:`~socon.core.management.BaseCommand` and
    :class:`~socon.core.management.ProjectCommand` inherit from
    :class:`~socon.core.manager.Hook` and define how a command works.
    Both of these classes are linked to the :class:`CommandManager` that defines
    the way we find these commands and the way we print the helper when you
    type ``python manage.py help``.

By subclassing a class from the :class:`~socon.core.manager.Hook` base class,
you make it discoverable by the manager it will be linked to.

In our previous example, we have defined a ``BuildManager``. We now need
to link hooks to this class. For that we must declare a Hook subclass and
make it discoverable by placing it inside a ``builder.py`` module. Previously, we have
define the :class:`BuildManager` with a ``lookup_module`` equal to ``builder``.
Let's create a ``builder.py`` next to the ``managers.py``.

.. code-block:: python
    :caption: myframework/builder.py

    from socon.core.manager import Hook


    class SpaceCraftBuilder(Hook):
        manager = 'spacecraft_manager'

        # Name of the builder
        name = "default_builder"

        def build(self, spacecraft: SpaceCraft):
            print("Building {}".format(spacecraft.name))

The important thing here is the name of the manager that this hook and all its
subclass will be linked to. This is really important. If you forget it, when
Socon will import the module, it will throw you an error.
Every class that inherit from :class:`~socon.core.manager.Hook` must define
the :attr:`~socon.core.manager.Hook.manager` attribute.

.. note::

    If you subclass ``SpaceCraftBuilder``, you don't need to redefine the
    manager as it will be inherited.

Access your hooks
-----------------

In order to access your hooks, you first need to :ref:`access your manager <access-your-managers>`.
Then you need to search for hooks and for that you have two options:

#. :meth:`~socon.core.manager.BaseManager.find_hooks_impl`. This method will look
   for hooks in a specific config. This means that you will have to provide a for
   example a :class:`~socon.core.registry.ProjectConfig`, and it will search for
   every hook in that config.

#. :meth:`~socon.core.manager.BaseManager.find_all`. This method will search in every
   config. It will search in every installed config and in the common space.

Now that you have searched for hooks, you can call the :meth:`~socon.core.manager.BaseManager.get_hook`
method. This method, requires a :class:`RegistryConfig` like a :class:`~socon.core.registry.ProjectConfig`
and the name of the hook to search for. Here is a quick example:

.. code-block:: python

    # ..
    class BuildCommand(ProjectCommand):
        name = 'build'

    def handle(self, config, project_config):
        manager = BaseManager.get_manager('build')
        manager.find_all()
        hook = manager.search_hook_impl(project_config, 'default_builder`)
        builder = hook()
        builder.build(
            type('SpaceCraft', (object,), {'name': 'Saturn Ib'})()
        )

As seen above, we are retrieving the build manager that we have defined in our previous
example. We request the manager to :meth:`~socon.core.manager.BaseManager.find_all`
hooks in every config. Afterwards we get the ``builder``
using the :meth:`~socon.core.manager.BaseManager.search_hook_impl` method and we
initialize our builder. Finally we build our spacecraft.

.. note::

    We could have used the :meth:`~socon.core.manager.BaseManager.get_hook` method as
    we know that there is a builder for that project. Be aware that if the hook
    is not found using that method, it will return ``None``.

.. _overiding-hooks:

Overriding hooks
----------------

During the search (when we call the :meth:`~socon.core.manager.BaseManager.find_all` method),
each hook is registered in a manager, like the ``BuildManager``,
and saved alongside its config object. When Socon looks for a hook using
:meth:`~socon.core.manager.BaseManager.search_hook_impl` it will proceed as follows:

    #. Did the user pass a config object?
        Yes, search the hook for that config. It is found return it
        else continue.

    #. Search in the common space config for hooks.
        If it's found return it else continue.

    #. Search in the plugins.
        If it's found return it else continue.

    #. Search in built-in Socon hooks
        if it's found return it else continue.

    #. Raise :exc:`~socon.core.exceptions.HookNotFound`.

To override a hook, the new hook must have the same name as the hook you want to
override. They also need to be part of the same manager.
Let's take an example to illustrate what we just said. Above, we have
created a ``SpaceCraftBuilder``. Let's say that a project wants to implement
its own builder with a specific feature. We would create a new ``SpaceCraftBuilder``
in the project itself. This way, our builder is found first when we are looking for it.

.. code-block:: python
    :caption: projects/apollo/builder.py

    from myframework.builder import SpaceCraftBuilder

    class ProjectSpaceCraftBuilder(SpaceCraftBuilder):
        name = 'default_builder`

        def build(self, spacecraft: SpaceCraft):
            self.prepare_docs()
            super().build(spacecraft)

        def prepare_docs(self):
            print("Prepare documents before building the spacecraft")

As you can see, the builder has the same name as the one we
declared earlier. It also inherit from the one in the common space. This builder
will do the exact same thing as the previous one but it will add a new
method to prepare the documentation before building the spacecraft. Now
when the manager will look for the `default_builder` hook, it will return
this one first.

.. _abstract-hooks:

Abstract hooks
--------------

The term ``abstract`` means that the hook you will define will not
be registered and available in the ``manager``. It is useful when
you want to make a hook as an interface for other hooks.

In our above example, we could have changed the ``SpaceCraftBuilder`` as a
``BaseBuilder`` class defined as abstract. And then inherit from
that class to create the ``SpaceCraftBuilder``.

.. code-block:: python
    :caption: myframework/builder.py

    from socon.core.manager import Hook


    class BaseBuilder(Hook, abstract=True):
        manager = 'spacecraft_manager'

        # Name of the builder
        name = "default_builder"

        def build(self, spacecraft: SpaceCraft):
            raise NotImplementedError(...)

    class SpaceCraftBuilder(Hook):

        def build(self, spacecraft: SpaceCraft):
            print("Building {}".format(spacecraft.name))
