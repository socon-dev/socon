================================
Change the behavior of a command
================================

Now that we have created multiple commands and projects, we are going to change
the behavior of these commands for a specific project. This is where things
get really interesting because, you can start to shape your framework as you
want in order to fit your needs.

How it works?
-------------

Socon works with managers and hooks. You can get more information :doc:`here </ref/manager>`.
Commands are hooks of the :class:`CommandManager` class. It's
this class that will look for every commands in the ``management/commands`` directory
that you have in the common space, your projects and even Socon.

When you start a command, Socon will look for this command in a specific order.
The last being the most important:

#. Socon
#. Plugins
#. Common
#. Projects

Here is an example: Let's use the ``build`` command that we created in the previous
:doc:`tutorial </intro/tutorials/1_project_and_command>`.
This command is common to all projects. If we don't redefine this command in one
of the project, the :class:`CommandManager` will return the command from the
common space.

Now, if we define the ``build`` command in the ``apollo`` project,
the :class:`CommandManager` will return that command instead of the one in the
common space.

Change the behavior
--------------------

To show the behavior described above, let's add a new argument to the ``apollo`` project.
To do that we will take a shortcut and copy the ``build.py`` file from the common space
to the ``apollo`` project:

.. code-block:: console

    $ cp tutorial/management/commands/build.py projects/apollo/management/commands/build.py

If you start the ``help`` command using ``python manage.py help`` you will
see that ``apollo`` has now a command called ``build``:

.. code-block:: console

    ...

    [apollo]

        build (P)

If you start the command as usual, you won't see any difference as it will
basically execute the same code. To change its behavior, instead of subclassing
this class from the :class:`ProjectCommand`, we will subclass it by the one in the common space.
This way, we use object inheritance and we have an extension of the build command
for the ``apollo`` project.

The :file:`build.py` of apollo:

.. code-block:: python

    from argparse import ArgumentParser

    from tutorial.management.commands.build import BuildCommand

    from socon.core.management.base import Config
    from socon.core.registry.base import ProjectConfig


    class BuildCommand(BuildCommand):
        name = 'build'

        def add_arguments(self, parser: ArgumentParser) -> None:
            super().add_arguments(parser)
            parser.add_argument(
                '--info', help='Add info to the handle command'
            )

        def handle(self, config: Config, project_config: ProjectConfig):
            print(config.getoption('info'))
            super().handle(config, project_config)


Now you just have to execute the command from the apollo project like this:

.. code-block:: console

    $ python manage.py build --project apollo --info "5 Days left"

You should see this result:

.. code-block:: console

    5 Days left
    Building Saturn IB

Congratulations! You have modified the behavior of the ``build`` command! You
can now build any spacecraft you want :)

.. note::

    This also works for general commands. If you declare the same command
    in one of your projects you will be able to access it if you add the
    :option:`--project` option to the command. Try it for yourself and change
    the behavior of the ``createcontainer`` command!
