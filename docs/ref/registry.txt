Registry
========

.. module:: socon.core.registry

Socon contain multiple config registry. Two that stores installed projects and plugins
configuration. One registry that store the configuration of Socon and the
common space. This mean that we have three different registry:

* A project registry: Store the installed projects configuration.

* A plugin registry: Store the installed plugins configuration.

* A common registry: Store two configuration. Socon core configuration and the
  common space configuration that is created alongside the container.

The registry is called :attr:`~socon.core.registry.registry` and it's available in
:mod:`socon.core.registry`. It's the main registry that help you access
configuration registries we mentioned above.

As an example you could access socon configuration this way:

.. code-block:: pycon

    >>> from socon.core.registry import registry
    >>> registry.common.get_registry_config('core`).name
    'socon.core'

.. warning::

    At this time do not try to access :attr:`registry.projects` or the
    :attr:`registry.plugins` as this two registry are not ready yet

Container, projects and plugins
===============================

A **container** is a Socon based framework. The container Python package is defined
primarily by a settings module, but it can also contains other module to
extend the functionality of your framework. For example, when you run
``socon createcontainer myframework``, you will get a ``myframework``
container directory that contains a ``myframework`` Python package with the
``settings.py`` module. This package is also the common space of your container.
It's in that space that you should define all modules that are common to your
projects::

    myframework/ (root directory)
        myframework/ (common space)
            settings.py
        projects/ (contain all projects)
        manage.py

The term **projects** in Socon describes a Python package that provides some
set of features and configuration. A project is a place to define or re-define
functionality that are common or not to other projects.

Projects can include or not modules to extend their base functionality. these
modules can be common to all the projects or re-defined by them.

.. note::

    It is important to understand that a Socon project is a set of code
    that interacts with various parts of the framework. There's no such thing as
    a ``Project`` object. However, there's a few places where Socon needs to
    interact with installed projects, mainly for configuration and also for
    introspection. That's why the project registry maintains metadata in an
    :class:`ProjectConfig` instance for each installed project.

The term **plugins** in Socon describes a Python package that provides some
set of feature that can be shared in a container to increase the functionality
of a Socon based framework. This was really important for us to integrate this in Socon.
reusability matters and it's the way of life of Python. We wanted to gives
the possibility to people to share their work and idea to everyone.

Imagine that you have work on your Socon based framework that calculate
the trajectory of a spaceship to go to space. You created a spaceship
:doc:`/ref/manager` to get all the information about a spaceship (its weight, its length...)
and a calculate command that will calculate and trace the trajectory.
How do you make this reusable ? You want people to be able to simply define a
spaceship and it will calculate everything for them. Well Socon provide a way
to create plugin and there is a good :doc:`tutorial </intro/tutorials/4_plugins>`
that explain everything for you.

Configuring projects
--------------------

To configure a project, create a file:`projects.py` module inside the
project, then define a subclass of :class:`ProjectConfig` there.

.. note::

    By default when you create a project ``socon createproject apollo``,
    Socon will automatically create the :file:`projects.py` file for you.

When :setting:`INSTALLED_PROJECTS` contains the dotted path to a project
module, by default, if Socon finds exactly one :class:`ProjectConfig` subclass in
the file:`projects.py` submodule, it uses that configuration for the project

If no :class:`ProjectConfig` subclass is found, the base :class:`ProjectConfig` class
will be used.

Alternatively, :setting:`INSTALLED_PROJECTS` may contain the dotted path to a
configuration class to specify it explicitly::

    INSTALLED_PROJECTS = [
        ...
        'projects.myproject.projects.ApolloProjectConfig',
        ...
    ]

Project config example:

.. code-block:: python
   :caption: projects/apollo/projects.py

    from socon.core.registry.base import ProjectConfig

    class ApolloConfig(ProjectConfig):
        name = 'projects.apollo'

.. important::

    Each :class:`ProjectConfig` has a :attr:`~ProjectConfig.label`. This attribute
    is the one that will be use when you call a command with the
    :option:`--project` option. You can change the label to anything you
    want but it must be unique across projects.

.. _project-setting-file:

Project setting file
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

When you create a project, by default Socon will create a ``management`` directory
with a ``config.py`` module. This module will save all the configuration
of your project. It act the same as :doc:`Socon general settings </ref/settings>`
but for your project. You can access all these settings using
:meth:`ProjectConfig.get_setting` method.

Configuring plugins
-------------------

To configure a plugin, create a file:`plugins.py` module inside the
plugin, then define a subclass of :class:`PluginConfig` there.

.. note::

    By default when you create a plugin ``python -m socon createplugin superplug``,
    Socon will automatically create the :file:`plugins.py` file for you.

When :setting:`INSTALLED_PLUGINS` contains the dotted path to a plugin
module, by default, if Socon finds exactly one :class:`PLuginConfig` subclass in
the file:`plugins.py` submodule, it uses that configuration for the plugin.

If no :class:`PluginConfig` subclass is found, the base :class:`PluginConfig` class
will be used.

Alternatively, :setting:`INSTALLED_PLUGINS` may contain the dotted path to a
plugin configuration class to specify it explicitly::

    INSTALLED_PLUGINS = [
        ...
        'suerplug.plugins.SuperPlugConfig',
        ...
    ]

Plugin config example:

.. code-block:: python
   :caption: superplug/plugins.py

    from socon.core.registry.base import PluginConfig

    class SuperPlugConfig(PluginConfig):
        name = 'superplug'

.. _common-space:

The common space
================

The term **common space** that we often use in Socon, refer to the container
Python package. It's in that directory that we will find the :file:`settings.py`
file and other file that will be consider as common to all projects.

Let's imagine that you have ten different projects and all of them must
access to a command that launch a spaceship into space. Instead of having this
command in every projects, you create this command in the common space. This
way, Socon will know that every project can call this command and launch
there own spaceship.

In the common space, you can register ``commands``, ``hooks`` and ``managers``.
Socon will automatically register them for you and make them available for
every projects.

Registry configuration
======================

.. class:: RegistryConfig

    The base class from which all config ultimately derive. Some
    attributes can be configured in :class:`~socon.registry.RegistryConfig`
    subclasses. Others are set by Socon and read-only.

Configurable attributes
-----------------------

.. attribute:: RegistryConfig.name

    Full Python path to the config, e.g. ``'projects.apollo'``.

    This attribute defines which config the configuration applies to. It
    must be set in all :class:`~socon.registry.RegistryConfig` subclasses.

    It must be unique across a Socon project.

.. attribute:: RegistryConfig.label

    Short name for the config, e.g. ``'apollo'``

    This attribute allows relabeling a config when two configs
    have conflicting labels. It defaults to the last component of ``name``.
    It should be a valid Python identifier.

    It must be unique across a Socon project.

.. attribute:: RegistryConfig.path

    Filesystem path to the application directory.

    In most cases, Socon can automatically detect and set this, but you can
    also provide an explicit override as a class attribute on your
    :class:`~socon.registry.RegistryConfig` subclass. In a few situations this is
    required; for instance if the config package is a namespace package with
    multiple paths.

.. attribute:: RegistryConfig.lookup_module_name

    Name of the module Socon will look for the configurations. By default,
    Socon will look into a :file:`config.py` file at the root of each
    installed configuration.

Read-only attributes
--------------------

.. attribute:: RegistryConfig.module

    Root module for the config, e.g. ``<module 'projects.apollo' from
    'projects/apollo/__init__.py'>``.

.. attribute:: RegistryConfig.registry

    The registry that hold this configuration.

Project configuration
=====================

.. class:: ProjectConfig

    Project configuration objects store metadata for a project.

Configurable attributes
-----------------------

.. attribute:: ProjectConfig.settings_module

    Python path to the settings module relative to the project package.
    By default this attribute is set to ``management.config``.

Read-only attributes
--------------------

.. attribute:: ProjectConfig.settings

    Project settings object. This follow the same principal as the
    general ref:'settings <settings-basic>`. You can access your project
    settings from there, as you would from ``socon.conf.settings``.
    We believe that setting should be access using the :meth:`~ProjectConfig.get_setting`
    method as it gives more functionality.

.. attribute:: ProjectConfig.lookup_module_name

    Default to ``projects.py``

Methods
-------

.. method:: ProjectConfig.get_setting(name: str, default=None, skip=False)

    Return a project settings. This function allow you to
    pass a default value if not found or raise a :exc:`ValueError`

    The :exc:`ValueError` is raised only if ``skip`` is set to ``False``.
    Otherwise, ``get_setting()`` will return ``None``

Plugin configuration
====================

.. class:: PluginConfig

    Plugin configuration objects store metadata for a plugin.

Read-only attributes
--------------------

.. attribute:: PluginConfig.lookup_module_name

    Default to ``plugins.py``

Base Registry
=============

.. class:: BaseRegistry

    The base registry provides the following public API. Methods that
    aren't listed below are considered private and may change without notice.

.. attribute:: registry.ready

    Boolean attribute that is set to ``True`` after the registry is fully
    populated.

.. method:: registry.get_registry_configs()

    Returns an iterable of :class:`~socon.registry.RegistryConfig` instances.

.. method:: registry.get_registry_config(config_label)

    Returns an :class:`~socon.registry.RegistryConfig` for the config with the
    given ``config_label``. Raises :exc:`LookupError` if no such config
    exists.

.. method:: registry.is_installed(config_name)

    Checks whether a config with the given name exists in the registry.
    ``config_name`` is the full name of the config, e.g. ``'projects.apollo'``.

Project registry
================

.. class:: ProjectRegistry

    The project registry inherit from the :class:`BaseRegistry`. This makes
    all the above method accessible by this registry.

.. method:: registry.projects.get_project_config_by_env()

    .. envvar: SOCON_ACTIVE_PROJECT

    Return a project config if the user has set the :envvar:`SOCON_ACTIVE_PROJECT`
    environment variable.

    Raise a :exc:`LookupError` in case the project does not exist.

Core Registry
=============

.. class:: CoreRegistry

    Register and initialize all configuration registry.

.. core-registry-read-only-attributes

Read-only attributes
--------------------

.. attribute:: CoreRegistry.projects

    Config registry that stores all installed projects

.. attribute:: CoreRegistry.plugins

    Config registry that stores all installed plugins

.. attribute:: CoreRegistry.commons

    Config registry that stores the common space config and Socon config.

Initialization process
======================

How config registries are loaded
--------------------------------

When Socon starts, the ``registry`` module is loaded and the registry object
is initialized. When this happen, we create the common registry that store
the core configuration object and loads all the Socon admin commands.

Then the  :func:`socon.setup()` is responsible for populating the projects,
plugins and common registry.

.. currentmodule:: socon

.. function:: setup()

    Configure Socon by:

    * Loading the settings.
    * Setting up the logging.
    * Initializing the config registries in a specific order:
        #. Plugins
        #. Projects
        #. Common space

.. currentmodule:: socon.core.registry

Each config registry are initialized in two stages, at each stage Socon
process all plugins and projects in the order of the :setting:`INSTALLED_PLUGINS` and
:setting:`INSTALLED_PROJECTS` respectively. We will take the installation
of projects as an example as it would be the same for plugins.

#. First Socon imports each items in :setting:`INSTALLED_PROJECTS`

   If it's a project configuration class, Socon imports the root package
   of the project, defined by its :attr:`~PluginConfig.name` attribute. If
   it's a Python package, Socon looks for a project configuration in an
   ``projects.py`` submodule, or else creates a default project configuration.

   For a plugin, Socon would look for a plugin configuration in a
   ``plugins.py`` submodule.

   For projects, we know that there is a :setting:`SKIP_ERROR_ON_PROJECTS_IMPORT`
   available in the settings. By default this setting is set to ``True``. This
   mean that even if there is an import error, Socon will continue to register
   every projects. You will see the error only when loading the project config
   itself. If you want to raise an error, set this setting to ``False``.

   Once this stage completes, APIs that operate on project configurations
   such as :meth:`~registry.get_registry_config()` become usable. In our
   case it would be :meth:`registry.projects.get_registry_config()`.

#. Then Socon attempts to import the ``managers`` submodule of each projects
   and plugins. This will trigger the import of all commands that are located
   in every config registered (plugins, projects and the common space).
