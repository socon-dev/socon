.. note::

    In Socon, the settings module has been inspired by Django settings module.
    A lot of it has been re-written but some part and some principal remains
    the same. This document, will mirror a part of their settings documentation.

A Socon settings file contains all the configuration of your Socon
installation. This document explains how settings work and which settings are
available by default. Settings are also available for projects, and will
be covered in this document as well.

.. _settings-basic:

The basics
==========

A settings file is just a Python module with module-level variables.

Here are a couple of example settings:

.. code-block:: python

    INSTALLED_PROJECTS = ['projects.apollo']
    LOGGING = {}

Because a settings file is a Python module, the following apply:

* It doesn't allow for Python syntax errors.
* It can assign settings dynamically using normal Python syntax.
  For example::

      MY_SETTING = [str(i) for i in range(30)]

* It can import values from other settings files.

Designating the settings
========================

.. envvar:: SOCON_SETTINGS_MODULE

When you use Socon, you have to specify which settings you're currently using.
Do this by using an environment variable, :envvar:`SOCON_SETTINGS_MODULE`.

The value of :envvar:`SOCON_SETTINGS_MODULE` should be in Python path syntax,
e.g. ``mysite.settings``. Note that the settings module should be on the
Python `import search path`_.

.. note::

    By default the :file:`manage.py` set this environment variable for
    you. You can check this by opening the file in your container.

.. _import search path: https://realpython.com/lessons/module-search-path/

Default settings
================

A Socon settings file doesn't have to define any settings if it doesn't need
to. Each setting has a sensible default value. These defaults live in the
module :file:`socon/conf/global_settings.py`.

Here's the algorithm Socon uses in compiling settings:

* Load settings from ``global_settings.py``.
* Load settings from the specified settings file, overriding the global
  settings as necessary.

Note that a settings file should *not* import from ``global_settings``, because
that's redundant.

Using settings in Python code
=============================

In your Socon projects, use settings by importing the object
``socon.conf.settings``. Example::

    from socon.conf import settings

    if settings.MY_VARIABLE:
        # Do something

.. warning::

    ``socon.conf.settings`` isn't a module -- it's an object. So
    importing individual settings is not possible::

        from socon.conf.settings import MY_VARIABLE  # This won't work.

Also note that your code should *not* import from either ``global_settings`` or
your own settings file. ``socon.conf.settings`` abstracts the concepts of
default settings and site-specific settings; it presents a single interface.
It also decouples the code that uses settings from the location of your
settings.

Altering settings at runtime
============================

You shouldn't alter settings in your applications at runtime. For example,
don't do this::

    from socon.conf import settings

    settings.MY_VARIABLE = XXXX   # Don't do this!

The only place you should assign to settings is in a settings file.

Available settings
==================

For a full list of available settings, see the :doc:`settings reference </ref/list-of-settings>`.

Projects settings
=================

Each project can define its own settings that will be loaded at the start
of the program. Project settings respect the :ref:`basics <settings-basic>` of
settings.

When you create your project, Socon create a :file:`config.py` file at the
root of your project inside the ``management`` folder.
This file is where you will define all your project related settings. By default
we don't load any settings as these settings are proper to your project.

Modify the path of my project settings
--------------------------------------

Socon provide a way to modify the path to your project settings file. If you
don't like the default path, you can modify the :attr:`ProjectConfig.settings_module` in your
project :class:`ProjectConfig` class:

.. code-block:: python
    :caption: projects/myproject/projects.py

    class MyProject(ProjectConfig):
        name = 'projects.myproject'
        settings_module = 'other_module.settings`

.. warning::

    The settings path should be in Python path syntax.

Access project settings
-----------------------

To access a project settings your first need to access to a project
config. There are two ways to access one:

* Running a project command. The :meth:`BaseCommand.handle` method expose a project
  config parameter. This config is the one loaded with the :option:`--project`
  option.

* Accessing a project config using Socon config :doc:`registry </ref/registry>`.

When you have your hand on a project config you can use the
:meth:`get_setting <socon.core.registry.ProjectConfig.get_setting>` method:

.. code-block:: python

    my_project_config.get_setting('MY_VARIABLE')
